Welcome to Ataraxia GNU/Linux
Ataraxia GNU/Linux is an independent Linux-based OS focusing on simplicity, security and privacy.

Intro
Ataraxia GNU/Linux is a Linux-based operating system, it was made from scratch and it follows three main principles: security, privacy and simplicity. Ataraxia GNU/Linux tries to be an innovative OS and therefore uses latest technologies from the GNU/Linux world. Ataraxia GNU/Linux is different from other distributions, for example it uses musl libc as the standard C library, LLVM/Clang toolchain as the default compiler, a significantly more secure SSL/TLS library called LibreSSL and simple userland tools such as Toybox, lobase (OpenBSD userland for Linux and) and some Plan 9 tools. Ataraxia GNU/Linux is oriented towards professional Linux users.

Simplicity
Despite using systemd, Ataraxia GNU/Linux is adhering a KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. It replaces mainstream components with simpler alternatives which do not sacrifice user experience. musl libc, toybox and lobase are just a few of them! Our code is simple and understandable that means it's easier to audit and/or fork.

Security
Like other popular distributions, Ataraxia GNU/Linux was compiled with PIC, PIE, SSP. However, Ataraxia GNU/Linux configures software to be more secure and it tries to decrease attack surface. Kernel is configured for better security, without compromise. Ataraxia GNU/Linux will provide new mitigations and security features like Control Flow Integrity (CFI), fork of PaX patchset.

Privacy
Ataraxia GNU/Linux does not collect any form of data and it does not allow proprietary software in its repositories. Proprietary software is known as a main tool to violate user's privacy. Furthermore, Ataraxia GNU/Linux developers are patching software to avoid any data collection.
